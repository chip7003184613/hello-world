# hello-world
A place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

I am extremely excited to learn coding to make a career change in becoming a Full Stack Developer. I love the idea of becoming a stronger asset to my current and future employers. I love the structure of coding and how things need to be working in the correct order for code to work the way it is supposed to. I am a former Student Athlete at Utah State University and I have a BS in Economics. I currently work in the Training Department as a QA (Quality Assurance) Supervisor at a financial call center. I have been working at my current job for 5+ years. I love video games and video game news. I also like sports: basketball, football, soccer, and Track and Field. I like to workout and spend time with my family. I am married with two children. I am an open book, so feel free to ask me questions. I would really love to get to know everyone.
